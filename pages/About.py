st.markdown(
    """
- **Plausible-looking arXiv ID, wrong paper.** Author copies a citation that says `arXiv:2305.00471` but the ID actually resolves to a completely different paper.
- **DOI from a neighbouring reference.** A reference's title and authors are real, but the DOI was accidentally pasted from the citation next to it.
- **Title-author mismatch.** A real paper title is paired with authors who didn't write it (often Vaswani et al. or similar high-frequency author lists hallucinated in).
- **Title that exists nowhere.** A confident-sounding citation that no academic database has ever heard of.
- **Venue mismatch.** Title and authors check out, but the venue listed is wrong (e.g. arXiv preprint cited as a conference paper).

Reviewers can't catch most of these in a manual pass — there's no shortcut for opening a DOI and checking it resolves to what the bibliography says. ARES does that for every reference automatically.

st.markdown("Three stages run when you upload a PDF:")

st.markdown(
    """
### 1. Parse references from the PDF

Four parser backends are available:

- **hybrid** *(recommended)* — combines GROBID's structured TEI output with a separate section-pipeline that uses PyMuPDF to locate the References section and sends each candidate citation through GROBID's `/api/processCitationList` endpoint. Recovers references each method misses alone.
- **grobid** — GROBID's full-document layout parser only.
- **pymupdf4llm** — fast regex-based extraction; brittle on irregular bibliographies.
- **docling** — same regex extractor backed by docling's layout analysis.

After parsing, each reference becomes a structured record with `title`, `authors`, `year`, `venue`, `doi`, and `url` fields plus the original raw citation text.

### 2. LLM repair *(optional)*

Backed by either the Anthropic API (Claude) or a TU Wien Aqueduct endpoint (Qwen, Gemma, etc). The LLM:

- Repairs garbled fields (e.g. when the regex parser mis-split authors and title).
- Flags entries that aren't actually citations (body-text fragments mis-classified by the parser).
- Recovers identifiers from the raw text that the structured extractor missed.

The LLM is opt-in. Disabling it makes runs ~30% faster but characterizes failure modes less precisely.

### 3. Validate against academic databases

Each reference is routed to the most relevant sources based on what identifiers it has. The router:

- arXiv-cited refs → arXiv lookup only (it's authoritative for arXiv IDs)
- DOI-cited refs → doi.org first (canonical metadata via content negotiation), then Crossref / Semantic Scholar / OpenAlex as a vote
- CS-conference venues → DBLP
- Book-shaped venues → Open Library
- Title-only refs → parallel fanout across S2, OpenAlex, Crossref, DBLP

Identifier-routed lookups are authoritative — if the cited arXiv ID resolves to a paper with a clearly different title, that's a confident `wrong_arxiv_id` flag, and we don't go shopping at other databases looking for a confirmation.

# Wrong-id detection
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
st.header("Wrong-identifier detection")

st.markdown(
    """
The strongest precision signal in the pipeline is **identifier mismatch**: when a reference includes a DOI or arXiv ID that resolves to a paper with a clearly different title than what's cited.

For example, a citation says:

> Chen, J., Li, R. & Wang, Q. (2023). *Evaluating the logical consistency of GPT models.* arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.00471.

When we resolve `arXiv:2305.00471` directly, we get back a paper titled *"Classification, α-Inner Derivations and α-Centroids of Finite-Dimensional Complex Hom-Trialgebras"* — a completely unrelated math paper. The arXiv ID was plausible-looking but fabricated.

This pattern is caught explicitly: when an identifier resolves to a title at < 50% similarity to the cited title, the reference is flagged with an inline warning explaining exactly what's wrong. The same logic applies to DOIs that resolve to neighbouring-reference papers (a classic copy-paste error).

To avoid blaming the user for identifiers the LLM repair pass might have injected itself, the wrong-identifier check looks only at the raw citation text and the parsed venue field — never at LLM-edited URL fields.

st.markdown(

Sometimes the parser misses a citation entirely (especially for unusual layouts or merged-block bibliographies). Two ways to add one manually:

**From the PDF.** Drag-select the citation text in the PDF viewer, then click the **"Add selected text as reference"** button in the viewer's toolbar. The selection is sent to GROBID for structuring, then appears as a new reference in the audit panel with a pending verdict.

**From the sidebar.** Open the **"Add a missed reference"** expander, paste the citation text, and click **"Add to references"**. Same flow — GROBID structures it, the reference enters the audit panel as pending.

Either way, the new reference shows up immediately without re-running the lookup pipeline. Click **"Look up N new ref(s)"** when you're ready to validate the newly-added entries. Refs that were already looked up keep their cached results.

You can also remove manually-added references from the sidebar list (click the **×** next to any entry).

    """
This tool reports what academic databases say.  It does not decide whether a
citation is correct.  Every result — green, yellow, or red — is a
**starting point for human verification**, not a final verdict.  The
specific failure modes you need to be aware of:
"""
)

st.markdown(
    """
- **"Verified" (green) can still be wrong.**  A reference is marked green when at least one source returns a high-similarity match.  But database matching is imperfect — the database can have a typo, the reference can list authors who didn't actually write the paper, or the title can be so generic that a near-match isn't the right paper.  Trust green only after spot-checking that the linked database entry really corresponds to the bibliographic record.
- **"Not found" (yellow) does not mean fabricated.**  Many real references aren't in academic databases at all — books, theses, technical reports, lab blog posts, very recent preprints, conference workshop papers, non-English venues, and grey literature.  When a reference is marked yellow, the only thing you've learned is that the system couldn't find it where it looked.  Open the original source and confirm it exists.
- **"Wrong paper" (red) is the most reliable signal — but still requires checking.**  Red is fired when a cited DOI or arXiv ID resolves to a paper with a clearly different title, or when a paper with the cited title has clearly different authors.  These are strong fabrication-or-error tells.  But: the system can mis-attribute a red flag (e.g. the LLM-extracted authors might be wrong, making a real citation look mis-attributed).  Open the cited identifier in your browser and compare against the bibliography entry before concluding the citation is bad.
- **LLM repair occasionally invents authors.**  The optional LLM repair pass cleans messy parsed fields, but it can also confidently hallucinate plausible-looking authors for incomplete citations.  We mitigate by only attributing identifier claims to text the user actually wrote, but author-list-level hallucinations can still leak through.  If a red flag is "title matches but cited authors don't", verify the authors in the original PDF — the system's view of who the authors are might itself be wrong.
- **Identifier extraction is best-effort.**  GROBID and the parser don't always recover the DOI or arXiv ID from the raw text — meaning the lookup falls back to title search, which is noisier.  When the tool reports "not found" for a reference that obviously has a DOI in the PDF, it's worth manually pasting that DOI into doi.org to confirm.
- **Database coverage is uneven.**  We query Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, Crossref, arXiv, DBLP, the ACL Anthology, Open Library, and (optionally) Google Scholar and CORE.  Coverage is good for mainstream CS / NLP / ML papers and shrinks for other fields, older work, non-Western venues, and non-paper outputs (datasets, software).  A red or yellow flag on a citation from outside the well-covered area is much more likely to be a false alarm.
- **Manually-added references inherit the same limitations.**  Adding a reference via PDF text selection runs the same lookup pipeline against the same databases.  All of the caveats above apply equally.

In short: **the tool surfaces candidates for review**.  It is not a fact-checker.  It is not a citation auditor of record.  A reference passing through this tool clean does not absolve the author of the responsibility to have actually read what they cite, and a flagged reference is an invitation to look at the source — not evidence to act on by itself.

- **First-time runs are slow; repeat runs are fast.** The persistent cache means that once a reference has been looked up, every future paper that cites it reads from disk.  A 50-reference paper takes ~1 minute cold, ~5 seconds warm.
- **GROBID needs to be running.** The `hybrid` and `grobid` parsers depend on a GROBID service at `localhost:8070`.  Start it with `docker compose up -d grobid`.
- **LLM repair is opt-in.**  Useful for messy PDFs where the regex extractor stuffed years or author fragments into the title field.  For clean publications it makes little difference and costs ~25 seconds per paper.
- **Google Scholar is disabled by default.**  Its broader coverage is valuable but it has no API and aggressively CAPTCHA-blocks scrapers.  Enable in the sidebar if you're processing references that lean toward grey literature.
- **Status colors on the PDF match the audit cards.**  The colored rectangles use the same green / yellow / red scheme as the audit panel.
