"""
Custom Streamlit component: PDF viewer with text-selection callbacks.

Renders a PDF in the browser via PDF.js, displays a text layer over the
canvas so users can select text natively, and streams the selected text
back to Python via Streamlit's component-value bridge.

Designed as a vanilla HTML+JS component — no React, no build pipeline.
Drops in as a replacement for streamlit_pdf_viewer when you need to capture
user interaction with the PDF.

Returned value
--------------
``pdf_selector(...)`` returns ``None`` when nothing has been selected, or a
dict ``{"text": str, "page": int, "rects": [[x0,y0,x1,y1], ...], "id": str}``
when the user clicks the "Add as reference" button in the viewer.  The ``id``
field is a monotonic token so consecutive selections of the same text still
trigger a Streamlit rerun (without it, the value wouldn't change and the
script wouldn't re-execute).

    Parameters
    ----------
    pdf_bytes : bytes
        The PDF file content.
    annotations : list[dict] | None
        Optional list of rectangles to draw on the PDF.  Each entry:

        Coordinates are in PDF points (PyMuPDF's native unit).
    height : int

    scroll_to_page : int | None
        1-based page to scroll into view on render.
    key : str | None
        Streamlit component key for state separation.

    Returns
    -------
    dict | None
        ``None`` until the user clicks the "Add" button.  Then a dict with the
        selection's text, page, bounding rects, and a unique id.
