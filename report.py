Generate a Markdown quality report for a set of validated references.

Severity tiers
--------------
Major error   – overall status is "mismatch": a paper was found in a database
                but the title is clearly wrong (wrong paper cited).
Moderate error– a wrong_doi flag: the DOI in the reference resolves to a
                different paper on Semantic Scholar.
Minor concern – title matched but venue/conference differs significantly
                (venue_label == "mismatch" in at least one validation source).
Not found     – no validation source could confirm the paper (books, theses,
                preprints not indexed anywhere are expected here).
Verified      – confirmed correct (title match, venue plausible).
